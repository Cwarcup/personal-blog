                I've always loved taking apart things, figuring out how they work, and putting them
                back together (or not, sorry Mom & Dad). I've been a lifelong learner, and I'm
                passionate about building great websites and sharing what I learn along the way.

                During my time at the University of British Columbia, I studied Kinesiology (the
                study of human movement) while I worked towards applying to medical school. After an
                unsuccessful application cycle, I decided to take a year off and work at Apple as an
                iPhone repair technician. This was an exciting time since Apple was offering their
                iPhone battery replacement program for $29, and I was able to help hundreds of
                customers save hundreds of dollars. I also got to work with some of the most
                talented people I've ever met, and I learned a lot about customer service and how to
                work with a team.
              </p>
              <p>
                I fell in love with the fast-paced environment of Apple and moved into a role as a
                Genius where I learnt how to handle complex technical issues and navigate difficult
                customer interactions. I quickly moved into a middle management role as a Lead and
                was responsible for all the daily operations of the store. I was able to learn a lot
                about how to manage a team, manage a budget, prioritize effectively and deal with
                ambiguity.
