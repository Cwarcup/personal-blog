Curtis is currently a manager at a Apple retail store. He manages a team of over 100 employees and is responsible for the daily operations of the store, including developing and facilitating in-store training events, scheduling, driving store initiatives while maintaining a positive environment for employees and customers.

Curtis began his journey coding as a side project, starting to learn code in the evening by following a road map provided by [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). After completing the ritual of making a calculator app, Curtis was hooked for more. He found himself waking up before work to complete projects and learn more and more. 

After falling in love with this new found passion, he hopes to change careers and pursue a career in software development.
