summary: Different languages will implement objects in different ways, but they all have a data type to store key-value pairs. JavaScript takes things a step further, as virtually everything is derived from Object. Almost everything.

# Summary

Objects are a fundamental data type in JavaScript, as it is designed around objects. Almost everything in JavaScript is an object.

An object is a collection of key-value pairs, where the key is a string and the value is an object or primitive.

```js
const myObject = {
  key: 'value',
  anotherKey: 'another value',
}
```

> The above code is an **object literal**, which is a way to create an object.
