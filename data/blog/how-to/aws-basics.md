# Basic AWS Concepts

## API ateway

It's important to understand how your API will be used. If you plan on making an API with API keys, this allows you to control who has access to use the API. Users must provide an API key to use the API. If you plan on making an API that is public, this allows anyone to use the API. If you plan on making an API that is private, this allows only authorized users to use the API. If you plan on making an API that is private and requires authentication, this allows only authorized users to use the API and requires them to be authenticated.

You can use **use plans** to control how many requests a user can make to the API. You can also use **rate limiting** to control how many requests a user can make to the API in a given time period. You can use **throttling** to control how many requests a user can make to the API in a given time period.

You can create groups of users and assign them different levels of access. You can also create users and assign them different levels of access. You can also create roles and assign them different levels of access.
