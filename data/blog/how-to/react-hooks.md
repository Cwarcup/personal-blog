# Beyond the Basic React Hooks

I think it's safe to say that react developers have used the basic hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useRef`. But as you start to use react more and more, you will find that there are many more hooks. Here are some of the more advanced hooks that I have found useful.

## useRef

Use the `useRef` hook when you want to "remember" a value, but don't want that value to trigger a re-render. This is useful when you want to store a value that you don't want to change, but you don't want to store it in state.

Examples include:

- A reference to a DOM node
  - i.e. `const inputRef = useRef()` and then `inputRef.current.focus()`
- A reference to a component instance
  - i.e. `const componentRef = useRef()` and then `componentRef.current.someMethod()`

### Using useRef to store a value

- import `useRef` from reac

  t

- inside your component, call `useRef` and pass in the initial value

```jsx
import { useRef } from 'react'

export default function App() {
  const ref = useRef(0)

  console.log(ref.current) // returns 0

  return <div className="App">{ref.current}</div>
}
```

- You can access the current value of the ref by calling `ref.current`
- This current value is intentionally **mutable**. You can change it by assigning a new value to it.
  - You can read and write to it, but it will not trigger a re-render.

```jsx
import { useRef } from 'react'

export default function App() {
  const ref = useRef(0)

  console.log(ref.current) // returns 0

  ref.current = 1

  console.log(ref.current) // returns 1

  ref.current++ // returns 2

  return <div className="App">{ref.current}</div>
}
```

Unlike state, ref is a plain JavaScript object contianing the `current` property. You can add any properties you want to it.

```jsx
import { useRef } from 'react'

export default function App() {
  const ref = useRef(0)

  ref.current = 1

  ref.current++ // returns 2

  ref.current = 'hello' // returns 'hello'

  ref.current = { name: 'John' }

  return <div className="App">{ref.current.name}</div>
}
```

When a piece of information is used for rendering, keep it in state. When a piece of information is only needed by event handlers and changing it doesnâ€™t require a re-render, using a ref may be more efficient.

### Ref vs State

| ref                                                                                         | state                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useRef(initialVal)` returns `{current: initialVal}`                                        | `useState(initialVal)` returns `[currentVal, setVal]`                                                     |
| Does **not** trigger a re-render                                                            | Triggers a re-render when you change it                                                                   |
| Mutable, meaning you can modify and update `current` value outside of the rendering process | Immutable, meaning you can only update it with `setVal`. When this occurs, a re-render **will** occur.    |
| Should not be used to read or write the `current` value during rendering                    | You can read state at any time. However, each render has its own snapshot of state which does not change. |

`useRef` is could be though of like a specific flavor of `useState`. Take the following example:

```jsx
// Inside of React
function useRef(initialValue) {
  const [ref, unused] = useState({ current: initialValue })
  return ref
}
```

During the first render, `useRef` return `{current: initialValue}`. This is the same as `useState({current: initialValue})`. However, `useState` will trigger a re-render when you change the value of `current`. `useRef` will not trigger a re-render.

### Examples of useRef

```jsx
import { useState, useRef } from 'react'

export default function App() {
  const [text, setText] = useState('')
  const [isSending, setIsSending] = useState(false)
  const timeoutRef = useRef(null)

  function handleSend() {
    setIsSending(true)
    timeoutRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
      alert('Sent!')
      setIsSending(false)
    }, 3000)
  }

  function handleUndo() {
    setIsSending(false)
    clearTimeout(timeoutRef.current)
  }

  return (
    <>
      <input disabled={isSending} value={text} onChange={(e) => setText(e.target.value)} />
      <button disabled={isSending} onClick={handleSend}>
        {isSending ? 'Sending...' : 'Send'}
      </button>
      {isSending && <button onClick={handleUndo}>Undo</button>}
    </>
  )
}
```

```jsx
import { useState, useRef } from 'react'

function DebouncedButton({ onClick, children }) {
  const timeoutRef = useRef(null)
  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        clearTimeout(timeoutRef.current)
        timeoutRef.current = setTimeout(() => {
          onClick()
        }, 1000)
      }}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  )
}
```
