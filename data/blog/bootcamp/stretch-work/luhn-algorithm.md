summary: Also known as the “Modulus 10 Algorithm”, the Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers.
---

The Luhn formula is used to validate a variety of identification numbers, such as credit card numbers. The way it does so is by applying a series of computations to the credit card number given, adding up the results of those computations, and checking whether the resulting number matches the expected result.

If the resulting number matches the expected result, the number is valid. If not, the number is invalid.
