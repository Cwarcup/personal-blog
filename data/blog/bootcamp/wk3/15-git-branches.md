We understand that a remote repository holds the 'master' branch of your code. This is the branch that is used to develop your application. We work locally on the 'master' branch and push to the 'master' branch on the remote repository.

That being said, we can use git branches to control and organize our development process. We do not need to only rely on the 'master' branch. We can create and use any branch we want.
