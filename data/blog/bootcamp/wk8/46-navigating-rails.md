summary: You may get a project that you need to work on, and you need to know how to navigate the codebase.

On the page you are interested in, refresh it.

The logs in the terminal will show you the request and the controller action that is being called.

```bash
Started GET "/products/12" for 127.0.0.1 at 2022-08-23 16:09:17 -0700
Processing by ProductsController#show as HTML
  Parameters: {"id"=>"12"}
	.....

	....

```

You know that this was processed by the `ProductsController` controller and the `show` action.

```rb
class ProductsController < ApplicationController

  def index
    @products = Product.all.order(created_at: :desc)
  end

  def show
    @product = Product.find params[:id]
  end

end
```

You can use `raise` to see what is happening in the controller action. Keep in mind that `raise` will stop the execution of the code.

```rb
class ProductsController < ApplicationController

	def index
		@products = Product.all.order(created_at: :desc)
	end

	def show
		raise
		@product = Product.find params[:id]
	end

end
```

If we refresh the page we will see a `RuntimeError in ProductsController#show`

Use the `raise.inspect` method to see what is in the instance variable.

```rb
  def show
    @product = Product.find params[:id]
    raise @product.inspect
  end
```

```bash
RuntimeError #<Product id: 12, name: "Cliff Collard", description: "The Cliff Collard is a very rare, tiny plant and c...", image: "plante_12.jpg", price_cents: 7999, quantity: 23, created_at: "2022-08-23 21:28:22.360985000 +0000", updated_at: "2022-08-23 21:28:22.360985000 +0000", category_id: 3>

```

This tells use we are raining an instance of `Product` with the id of 12.

Back to our original question, where is the HTML template being rendered?

> so far we only know we have two instance variables being set with Active Record queries.

Back to our logs!

```bash
app/controllers/products_controller.rb:8:in `show'
Started GET "/products/12" for 127.0.0.1 at 2022-08-23 16:16:02 -0700
Processing by ProductsController#show as HTML
  Parameters: {"id"=>"12"}
  Product Load (4.5ms)  SELECT "products".* FROM "products" WHERE "products"."id" = $1 LIMIT $2  [["id", 12], ["LIMIT", 1]]
  â†³ app/controllers/products_controller.rb:7:in `show'
  Rendering layout layouts/application.html.erb
  Rendering products/show.html.erb within layouts/application   ???? we can see the view being rendered
  ...
	...

```

Lets open the `products/show.html.erb` file.

```erb
<section class="products-show">
  <header class="page-header">
    <h1><%= link_to @product.category.name, @product.category %> &raquo; <%= @product.name %></h1>
  </header>

  <article class="product-detail">
    <%= image_tag @product.image.url, class: 'main-img' %>
    <div>
      <h1><%= @product.name %></h1>
      <p><%= @product.description %></p>
      <div class="quantity">
        <span><%= @product.quantity %> in stock at </span>
        <span><%= @product.price %></span>
      </div>
      <div class="price">
        <%= button_to add_item_cart_path(product_id: @product.id), class: 'btn' , method: :post do %>
          <%= fa_icon "shopping-cart", text: 'Add' %>
        <% end %>
      </div>
    </div>
  </article>

</section>
```

if we add a `!` to the end of a tag, it should modify the HTML.

```erb
<div>
      <h1><%= @product.name %>!</h1>
		// ...
```

> returns html with an exclamation mark after the product name. "Cliff Collard!"

You can also add a `raise` inside of the view to see what is available to you.

```erb
    <%= raise @product.inspect %>
```

```bash
Showing /Users/curtis/code/jungle-rails/app/views/products/show.html.erb where line #9 raised:

#<Product id: 12, name: "Cliff Collard", description: "The Cliff Collard is a very rare, tiny plant and c...", image: "plante_12.jpg", price_cents: 7999, quantity: 23, created_at: "2022-08-23 21:28:22.360985000 +0000", updated_at: "2022-08-23 21:28:22.360985000 +0000", category_id: 3>
```

You cal also add `<%= debug @product %>` to the view to see what is available to you.

```erb
		<%= debug @product %>
```

```

    their growth.\n  They can be brewed as tea.\n  \n  As a defense mechanism the

    to reproduce. Once pollinated, they grow small, inedible fruits."

> is a yaml representation of the product object. A lot of this is not useful to us, but it is good to know what is available to us.
