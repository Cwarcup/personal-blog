In Web Dev, we often have to manipulate data in some way. We can do so using the CRUD operations.

| CRUD Actions | Description         | Example                                       |
| ------------ | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Create       | Create a new record | `user[123] = {fName: 'Curt', lName: 'Warcup}` |
| Read         | Read a record       | `user[123]`                                   |
| Update       | Update a record     | `user[123].fName = 'John'`                    |
| Delete       | Delete a record     | `delete user[123]`                            |

## CRUD and HTTP

Recall that HTTP is the protocol used to facilitate communication between the interface and the database (with the browser and server in between).

```
|-client-|     |------- server -------|

          ----->            ----->
browser    HTTP    Server.js       Database
          <-----            <-----
```

When HTTP was first created, it was used to transfer data between the client and server. To get those requests, the client sent a request to the server. The server responded with a response. The request must use the appropriate HTTP method.

| HTTP Methods | CRUD Actions |
| ------------ | ------------ |
| GET          | Read         |
| POST         | Create       |
| PUT          | Update       |
| DELETE       | Delete       |

**Safe Methods**: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS, TRACE. Has no intended effect on the server. They are intended to be _read-only_ operations.

On the other hand, the following methods are _unsafe_: POST, PUT, DELETE. These methods can be used to modify the database.

#### idempotent methods

A request method is **idempotent** if multiple identical requests with that method have the same effect as a single such request. PUT and DELETE are said to be idempotent. PUT and DELETE methods, meanwhile, are idempotent since **successive identical requests will be ignored**.

Sending an identical POST request multiple times may further modify the state of the server or have further effects, such as sending multiple emails. Therefore, POST is not idempotent.

In Summary:

- GET: Reads data from the database.
- POST: Create resources in the database.Use when updating in a non-idempotent way.
- PUT: Want to update some resources.
- DELETE: Delete resources from the database.
